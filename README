The purpose of this project is to understand where in Philadelphia has the most car crash.
We to break it down by districts!

The API I used was from
https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/fatal-crashes
https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6510bfe4d500460caef528511d084335_0.csv

How I used them by picking which data I wanted to use and counting how many times it happened.

The first part of the project was to compare districts to death by a bar chart.
We found out District 15 had the most fatal crashes, while District 17 had the least.

The second part of the project was a trend line.
I wanted to know if there was a trend of deaths for each year. 

What I found was quite shocking was 2020 had the most death compare to the other years.
Knowing COVID started in 2020, how did we ended up with more crashes compare to 2021?
